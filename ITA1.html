<h2>Personal information</h2>
			<p>Name: Mingrui Liu</p>
			<p>Student ID: s3776094</p>
			<p>Email: s3776094@student.rmit.edu.au</p>
			<p>Background: I’m from China, I speak mandarin. My major is information system, and this is my last semester in RMIT. Besides studying, I like to spend my time on sports such as tennis, badminton….in addition, I also like to play video games like LOL and CSGO.</p>
<h2>My Interest In IT</h2>

					<p>The reason I chose RMIT at the beginning was just because RMIT is in the CBD, it is very convenient to go to school and live, and my cousin also studied at RMIT. But as I study at RMIT, I gradually feel that it is a dynamic school, and the teachers are very willing to help me academically, which makes me feel more sense of belonging with RMIT.</p>
					<p>My most interest in IT is AI, I started to be interested in IT when I was in high school, no specific people or things had an impact on me, but at that time I liked watching related videos on YouTube very much. For example, many youtuber designed some simple machine that are convenient for life. And many types of UAVs have been developed such as used to put out fires, used to detect where people can't get in. I think this has a big impact on the convenience and safety of our future lives.</br>
				I hope to learn more about AI in the future, such as machine learning, human-computer interaction and so on.</p>

<h2>Ideal Job</h2>
<img src="images/job.jpg"></br>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/56118762?type=standout#sol=71b0bc7cd8b65bf3f666a68daeab94133e18fdc4">AI Product Delivery Manager</a>
					<p>The main goal of this work is to help the team develop, plan and coordinate the use of a custom and emerging technology for machine learning in in vitro diagnostic devices. The reason why this job attracts me is not only the high salary and related to the IT direction I am interested in, but also help me realize my personal value. I think helping to develop medical devices can help more patients.</p>
					<p>This job requires me to have a tertiary qualification in a relevant major and relevant experience in software engineering and data management, from developing and maintaining high-fidelity datasets and experience in product or software development in a regulated industry, preferably in a medical-related industry. In addition, excellent planning, management and communication skills are required.</p>
          <p>The relevant skills I have now are communication skills, experience with some management a team and some python skill and SQL skill. I don’t have enough skills to develop a software yet. I will continue to study related skills and various programming languages in the future study and try to start looking for internships which related to my major during completion of master's degree. step by step closer to my Ideal Job.</p>

<h2>Personal Profile</h2>
<h3>Myers-Briggs test</h3>
<img src="images/Myers-Briggs test.jpg">
			<p>This has given me a more detailed understanding of my personality and a clearer understanding of my strengths and weaknesses. In the future teamwork, I will use my strengths such as being willing to listen to others and being very responsible for the tasks that need to be done, but to avoid being too idealistic, pursuing an unrealistic goal, and don't habitually teaching others.</p>
<h3>learning style test</h3>
<img src="images/learning style test.jpg">
<p>This test makes me better understand my learning style and I am more sensitive to auditory and vision. Then I will use videos or charts to help me in my future work and study.</p>
<h3>Big Five Personality test</h3>
<img src="images/Big Five Personality test.jpg">
<p>I score relatively high in openness and conscientiousness, which shows that I am more creative and more self-disciplined and self-controlling. I can better utilize these two advantages in teamwork. Provides more useful ideas while also better supervising the completion of established projects.</p>
<h2>Project Idea</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The purpose of this project is to develop a small household grabbing robot, which will have a robotic arm and a chassis for moving, this robot can be used to help people with reduced mobility to pick up the things they want like food or tools, it enables people to get what they want without moving. In addition, we will try to add a voice recognition system in subsequent upgrades to make it easier for people to control it.</p>
<h3>Motivation</h3>
<p>The reason why I am interested in this project and want to develop it is that it can help many people with limited mobility, such as the disabled, the elderly living alone, etc., so that they have a more convenient life and improve their ability to live independently. “One billion people, or 15% of the world's population, experience some form of disability.” Nearly 200 million people have serious functional disorders, which seriously affect their lives. At the same time, the aging of the world population is becoming more and more serious. It is expected that the population over 60 will account for 22% of the world population in 2050. Therefore, after the development of this project is completed, the market demand for the product will be very high. Not only make profit, but also helps a lot of people, which better helps me realize my self-worth.</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>First at all, the machine consists of a robotic arm and a base. The robotic arm is used to grab objects, and the base is used to move. In addition, infrared sensors, pressure sensors and cameras are necessary, which can help the robot to judge the distance and success of grasping or not. At the same time, it also makes users better remote control the robot.</p>
<p>The purpose of developing this product is to make it easier for people with disabilities to get what they want when there is no one to take care of them, making their lives more convenient and safer. They can stay where they are and rely on the remote control or mobile phone to control the robot and rely on the robot's camera to observe more conveniently.</p>
<p>Due to technical difficulties, the product will not have voice control technology at the beginning, it will only be operated with the remote control, but in order to take care of users with inconvenient hands, we will also focus on the development of this technology in the future, in this way, users only need to use language to control the machine. But this requires users to scan their home with the machine in advance and plan a route for the machine.</p>
<h3>Tools, technologies and skills required</h3>
<p>The open-source tools we need to use is Facebook’s PyRobot, and I also need various mechanical parts such as pan tilt, motor, wheel, circuit board, camera, sensor, etc. PyCharm is used for programming. Knowledge of many related disciplines will be used in the development process. We will face many difficulties in robot development for example, how can we set the parameters of the shrink strength so that it doesn't drop the item without damaging it? How to use the same clip to clamp different shaped items? How to set the pickup speed so as not to damage the item? And so on. which requires a lot of expertise, programming ability, mathematical statistics and certain electronic engineering skills are necessary. This requires the cooperation of people from different disciplines to develop.</p>
<h3>Outcome</h3>
<p>If the project is successful, we have successfully made the robot. IT’s still not a product that can be put on the market immediately. It is just an initial test machine. We will need more time to test it to ensure its safety. and functions normally. At the same time, we will also redesign its shape to make it look good and better protect its hardware. In addition, its success can also give the team more confidence and better prepare for the next upgrade.</p>
